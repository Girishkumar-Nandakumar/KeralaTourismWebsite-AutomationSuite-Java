🎓 Software Testing Capstone Project: Kerala Tourism Web Application  
----------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 **Objective**  
To validate the **functional, performance, security, and accessibility** aspects of the Kerala Tourism Website using modern QA methodologies and automation tools.

---

✨ **Project Highlights**  
-------------------------
- Full-cycle QA implementation — from manual to automation.
- Multi-tool integration: **Selenium, Selenide, Playwright, JMeter, OWASP ZAP, Lighthouse**.  
- Covers **Functional, Security, Performance, and Accessibility** testing.  
- Structured reports and dashboards aligned with **IEEE 829** & **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119** standards.

---

🌟 **Project Overview**  
-------------------------
This project demonstrates a **comprehensive end-to-end testing suite** for the *Kerala Tourism Website* hosted on GitHub Pages.  
The goal was to assess the website’s **functionality, responsiveness, security posture, and performance stability** while building a **reusable, professional-grade test automation framework** in Java.  

It represents a **full Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** — from **test planning, execution, automation scripting, and reporting**, to **defect tracking, RCA, and final recommendations**.

🔍 **Testing Scope**
---------------------
### ✅ Manual Testing  
- Functional validation of navigation, login, signup, and form behavior.  
- UI/UX inspection and defect classification by severity.  
- Cross-browser validation (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).  

### 🤖 Automation Testing  
- Selenium + TestNG framework built from scratch.  
- End-to-end workflows and negative test validation.  
- Screenshot capture and logging on test failure.  

### ⚙️ Performance Testing  
- Conducted **Load, Stress, Spike, and Soak** tests using Apache JMeter.  
- Simulated up to **5000 virtual users**; analyzed throughput and response trends.  

### 🔐 Security Testing  
- Automated scanning using **OWASP ZAP**.  
- Identified **XSS injection** and missing HTTP headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options).  
- Verified that no critical data exposure or session misconfigurations exist.  

### ♿ Accessibility Testing  
- Evaluated with **Lighthouse** and **PowerMapper**.  
- Accessibility score: **88/100** — issues found with color contrast and missing alt text.
